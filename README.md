## Introduction
The **Library Management System** is a web application that helps users manage a library by performing CRUD operations on book records. It allows users to add, view, update, delete, issue, and return books.

## Features

- 📋 View all available books in a tabular format.

- 🗑️ Delete books from the library.
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface with responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the application.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing book data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for interacting with MongoDB.
- **EJS**: Template engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- **CSS**: Styling for the user interface.
